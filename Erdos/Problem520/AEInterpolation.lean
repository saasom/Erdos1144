# Almost-sure interpolation from a cofinal test sequence

This file isolates the deterministic interpolation step used after estimates
have been proved on a sparse sequence of test points.  In particular, it does
not encode interpolation failure as a sequence of fixed exceptional events.
Both the test-point constant and the interval-increment constant may depend on
the sample.

test points.  The right side uses the scale at the upper endpoint; this is the
form naturally produced by maximal interpolation lemmas.  The constant is
allowed to depend on the sample. -/
